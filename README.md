# Hapi-Joi-Lab-Code

Have a fully tested hapi api server with 2 sets of endpoints.

Joi should provide payload validation.

Lab tests should provide code coverage analysis.

The codebase will be written for the latest stable version of `node`.

Create a set of endpoints (Counter) then write tests for it.

Write tests for the next set of endpoints for (KVStore), then implement the api for (KVStore)

The goal is to become familiar with how hapi returns joi validation errors (Boom errors) and understand how to test against them.

Then understand enough of the KVStore api spec to write failing tests against an api that is not yet implemented.
